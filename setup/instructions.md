You will need three things set up on your laptop: 

    A bash-style terminal  

    (not Windows CMD or Windows PowerShell) 

    Included in MacOS and Linux distributions already 

    git 

    A Python 3 installation, with the pytest module installed. 

You may have this already set-up. You can check this by opening your terminal (Windows: search for “git bash” in the start menu / Mac: Spotlight search for “terminal” / Linux: Search for “terminal” on your desktop’s application menu) and running the following three commands, one after the other. 

    git --version 

    python --version 

    pytest --version  

If the results look like the picture below (Note that the python --version output should start with a 3 (the exact numbers you see on the screen for all these tools may be different to those shown below), you are ready for the workshop. If not, please install these using the instructions attached to this email to get ready for the workshop. 

Take a look at the instructions for your operating system:

- [Linux](instructions_linux.html)
