Pytest is a Python package that we will use in the workshop to write tests for your code.

- If youâ€™ve installed Anaconda, you will already have pytest installed.
- If you are planning to use your own python setup, use `pip` (or other package manager) to install `pytest`, by running the following command in your command line: `pip install -U pytest`
(if your default version is Python 2, use `pip3` instead of `pip`)

Check that the installation has worked (version number may differ):

```
$ pytest --version
pytest 6.2.3
```
